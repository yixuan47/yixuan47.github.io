<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master student majoring in Control Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, with an anticipated graduation in March 2025.

I am now researching data-driven model predictive control for uncertain systems and working on developing various industrial control software.

I won the Outstanding Student Award(Top 3%) and First Prize Academic Scholarship in 2023 at SJTU and received the Outstanding Poster Paper Award from the Chinese Process Paper Congress in 2024(Top 3%).

My research interest includes data-driven techniques, robust control, model predictive control, distributed optimization, machine learning, and decision-making.
